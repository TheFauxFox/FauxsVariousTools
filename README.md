# Faux's Various Tools/Tweaks

I love the mod FVT by Flourick, however they've recently deleted their Github and only their archive is left 
(as well as some forks).

This is an unofficial fork of Flourick's FVT with some options removed, and some code refactored to suit my own liking
as well as some of my friends. Most of the code is copied, as the way it's written is fantastic and I appreciate their
original project. I'm also trying to get this out ASAP, as my friends really miss the original project, so re-using some
of the original code is my best bet to get it out. 

However, I am eventually going to add my own items into this project, making it a bit more of a distinct project.
